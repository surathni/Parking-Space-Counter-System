# Parking-Space-Counter-System
AI-driven parking space counter system is implemented in this using CV, ML. 

The AI-Powered Parking Space Conter System represents a transformative solution to address the pressing challenges of urban parking management. This innovative project leverages the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence and computer vision to accurately detect and classify the occupancy status of parking spaces in real-time, enhancing urban mobility and user convenience. This uses the YOLOV8 pre-trained model for object detection to check if a car is available in the parking space or not.
